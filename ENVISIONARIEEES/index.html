                The Visionarieees Design Competition is a quarter-long, project-based competition. 
                It aims to motivate college students to collaborate in interdisciplinary teams toward a broad project prompt. 
                To support this, they will be given access to a wide range of arts and engineering materials (through the Envision Maker Studio)
                and tools, workshops, and mentors. 
                During the 8 weeks that the competition is active, teams of 4-6 will work together to create a final product and video submission that align with the chosen prompt.
